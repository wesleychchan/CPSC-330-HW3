    "There were two features that seemed to have different histogram shapes for the two different classes, which could suggest that these features could be used in classification. Age had a more normal distribution around 45 years old for >50K income, compared to the more linear curve for <=50K income. The histogram for education seemed to have a more normal distribution for <=50K income but a left-skewed distribution for >50K income. Other than these, the other features seem to overlap quite consistently, so it may be hard to retrieve any information from those features alone (aside from interaction effects). "

If data leakage occurs, we will see a better score for our model, but this is not indicative of the model's performance on truly unseen data. In other words, it will make us overconfident in our model's capabilities. \n",

    "### 5.3 Hyperparameter optimization\n",
    "rubric={accuracy,quality}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for the hyperparameter `C` of SVC RBF classifier. In practice, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for all different hyperparameters of the most promising classifiers. For the purpose of this assignment, we'll only do it for the `SVC` classifier with one hyperparameter, namely `C`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each `C` value in the `param_grid` below: \n",
    "    - Create a pipeline object with two steps: preprocessor from 4.4 and `SVC` classifier with the `C` value.\n",
    "    - Carry out 5-fold cross validation with the pipeline.  \n",
    "    - Store the results in `results_dict` and display results as a pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "2. Which hyperparameter value seems to be performing the best? In this assignment, consider the hyperparameter value that gives you the highest cross-validation score as the \"best\" one. Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Running this will take a while. Please be patient. "
